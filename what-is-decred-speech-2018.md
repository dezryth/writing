**What is Decred and Why?**

**Dezryth - 2018**

**Specific Purpose:**

To inform my audience of the Decred project and leave them with an understanding of the principals, direction, and value of the project to the Cryptocurrency space.

**Central Idea:**

Decred is an open source project building an agile, adaptable cryptocurrency with the intent to place sovereignty with the users and control over the direction of the project with those invested in the future of the currency.

**Background of Project**

* Conformal Labs – Since 2013 ([https://blog.conformal.com/](https://blog.conformal.com/))

    * Open Source development. All code was open and transparently hosted on GitHub (and still is today)

    * Main product was cyphertite, an online backup storage solution utilizing the latest in cryptography for high-security

    * Created CoinVoice. Payment plugins for merchants accepting cryptocurrencies [https://blog.conformal.com/coinvoice-begins-processing-payments-from-btc-to-usd/](https://blog.conformal.com/coinvoice-begins-processing-payments-from-btc-to-usd/)

         

* Transition to Company 0 in 2014

    * BTCD (Btcsuite) Development – Golang implementation of bitcoind

    * Pushback from Bitcoin Core Team

* Decred born out of desire to solve underlying issues seen with Bitcoin. (https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/11/bitcoins-biggest-challenges/)

**Issues with Bitcoin**

* Project Governance:

    * Control over project centralized, Bitcoin Core Team, Block Stream

    *  Contentious issues lead to unfavorable options. E.g. block size increase

    * Bitcoin development has gone from an autocracy to an informal oligarchy comprised of groups of bitcoin core developers supported by organizations with their own interests

    * Merchants and developers of non-core Bitcoin software have zero influence in decisions affecting the future of Bitcoin.

* Funding Development

    * Bitcoin development was donation until 2014, when a majority of BTC developers founded Blockstream, a VC backed company, intertwining the interests of financiers with the development of the project.

    * Several developers have also joined MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative due to lack of funding, creating another conflict of interest and an effective veto of potential changes to Bitcoin

    * Funded development from external entities leads to an expectation of a certain amount of influence over decisions and public facing discussion of opinions.

* PoW Miners having too much power

    * Not enough incentives for good behavior.

    * PoW miners have enormous unchecked influence.

    * Control transactions included, and which blocks are acceptable.

    * Can mine empty blocks, censor transactions, or hinder new consensus rules from being added.

    * Block reward is still received regardless if the block has 0 transactions.

    * Miners can band together an force an upgrade, providing yet another effective veto over consensus rule changes.

    * Development of Decred started in April 2014. Launched February 8th, 2016

 

**Decred Overview: **

* "Decred is fundamentally about technological progress" – Jake Yocom-Piatt

* Decred is NOT a fork of any other cryptocurrency. The codebase’s closest relation is Bitcoin due to the codebase being an implementation of bitcoind in Golang.

* Robust Hybridized PoW/PoS consensus system. Result of theoretical proposals by Proof-Of-Activity and MC2 in 2013. Provides accountability and a check/balance between miners and stake holders influence over consensus rules and changes to the network.

* dcrd is a fork of btcsuite codebase and benefits from the latest developments added to Bitcoin and ported to btcd.

**Distribution of block subsidy**

* 10% to Development Fund

    * Self-funded development via block subsidy

10% of each block reward subsidy goes to a development fund to fund future development as well as proposals submitted and voted upon to extend and support the Decred ecosystem.

* 60% to PoW Miners

    * This percentage was chosen to prevent early adopters from always maintaining their level of influence without additional investment in the project or PoW mining equipment.

* 30% to Decred Stakeholders

    * Anyone can purchase a ticket to participate in the governance (optional) and/or PoS mining of Decred that is incentivized by a reward of 30% of the block reward

**Governance via Proof of Stake** 

* Allows for potential changes to be included with software releases, be voted on, and either activate or not dependent upon the vote outcome. PoW miners can also vote to strip the reward from miners who are not updating their software to keep in line with the rest of the network.

*  Any feature can be removed or implemented with 75% of stakeholder approval. This allows for an **agile** cryptocurrency where contentious changes come to a vote and the vote is binding. Life moves on. This is known as Consensus Voting and Decred has been the first to implement it with working code with success.

*  Direction of the project will be akin to the way a typical Open Source project evolves, with an exception that stakeholders will be able to vote on changes that affect the underlying consensus rules of the network and can vote to fund proposals submitted by those looking for funding to build out the ecosystem and provide value to Decred.

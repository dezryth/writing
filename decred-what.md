# What

If you’re here, you’re probably wondering what Decred is. To explain that, you first need to understand cryptocurrencies in general. Everything you read here won’t apply to every cryptocurrency you come across, so make sure you DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before deciding to invest.

On a very basic level with cryptocurrency:
You have complete control over your own “bank account”.*
You are responsible for securing it. You hold the key, and you can store the entirety of your wealth, or to be more specific, the singular key to access that wealth, on a single USB or even a piece of paper if you so choose!
Amounts in your “account” (which is most commonly referred to as a “wallet” within the crypto community) are associated with “addresses”.
All you need to transact with another person is an address with which to receive or send funds.
When you spend or receive money using cryptocurrency technology, you provide an address that acts similarly to a bank account/routing number. The difference being funds reach and settle to your “account” in a matter of minutes.
Think about how long it takes for your paycheck funds to finally become available. Now consider the convenience of only needing to wait a few minutes!
Transaction fees to transfer funds are low, and serve as incentive to those running specialized hardware and software to secure the network.
Those of which we are referring to are referred to as “miners”, and as you become more knowledgeable in the cryptospace, you may be interested in becoming one yourself! It can be a lucrative and fairly passive income.

* This is optional, although highly recommended. You can leave your funds in a wallet controlled by a third party, but this leaves you at risk to that third party being attacked and your funds being in jeopardy. This is currently the situation with your cash in the bank, though there is no FDIC insuring your funds.

## Why

Now that you have a very basic idea of the what, why should you care about cryptocurrencies?
Financial Technology, or Fintech, is an industry exploding with growth. A HUGE swath of this is cryptocurrency related. It’s possible that in the near future, talents and acumin related to cryptocurrencies can put you at an advantage for the jobs of the future.
You are still early! Many believe it’s now too late to get into cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin reaching into the thousands of dollars, how can it possibly be that there is still money to be made?
Cryptocurrencies are not even CLOSE to mainstream yet. Until you can buy a cup of coffee with a cryptocurrency at a cafe in your area, it has not come close to being mainstream.
Try asking a friend what they know about cryptocurrencies. If they respond with more than you’ve learned from this page, then you’ve got a tech savvy friend who’s paying attention! Most likely you are the most informed with cryptocurrencies in your circle.
Fiat currencies depreciate over time due to inflation. This is also true of some cryptocurrencies, which is why you must DYOR before investing.

## Why Decred

Decred is capped at a certain amount, meaning there will only ever be X amount of DCR available ever, period. The value of your Decred will not depreciate due to an ever increasing supply.
In fact, as the market value of Decred increases, smaller and smaller denominations of Decred will be used to transact for everyday purchases. Like most currencies, Decred is divisible. Unlike most currencies, the divisibility of Decred does not stop at 1/100th of the base denomination. It can be divided ad infinitum depending on the value of a Decred relative to the product or service you wish to purchase.

*Governance.*

Decred has very solid fundamentals and a constitution that lend itself to putting the users of the coin first.
While many cryptocurrencies in the space vary from thinly veiled scam to complex, difficult to understand scams, Decred has taken a different approach. It is designed from the ground up to be a completely decentralized currency, with no one single company, country, or entity claiming power to influence its direction.
This is contrary to EVERY other cryptocurrency in the space. Due to how the underlying technology of cryptocurrency works, power to influence change typically lies in the hands of those who control the hardware that secures the network and transactions across the network; the “miners”.
With Decred, just as “miners” are incentivized to secure the network and process transactions for a reward, so are users of the coin invested in its prosperity to “vote with their wallets” on proposals and actions across the network, serving as a check and balance upon miners. Those who participate in this wallet invest a portion of their Decred into a vote which remains locked for anywhere between 1-148 days. In doing so, they engage in the governance system of Decred and earn a return on their investment of around ~2%*

*Returns for voting are subject to demand for participation in the governance system, which influence the vote price, as well as the current voting reward subsidy.
